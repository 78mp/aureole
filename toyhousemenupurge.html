BEFORE EDITING:
    1. Please disable WYSIWYG mode before editing.
    2. Get the links to all the sidebar links on your default profile. You will need these to fill in your new sidebar below.
    3. Test this out on an alt account if possible. If you don't have access to an alt account, please make a back up of your current profile.
    4. This code is only meant for user profiles, do not use this on character profiles as it will not work correctly.
